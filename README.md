1. Telephone User Guide: I wrote this guide as part of a writing test for a job at Credit Suisse. I got the job.
2. Citibank API Guide: Produced this guide for Citibank's client developers. This part was taken from original, web-based manual, modified and uploaded as a Word document.
3. Citeline Online Help picture files: Screen captures of an online help system that I created for Informa's Citeline family of Web products. These guides were aimed at teaching newly-hired developers about the internal workings of those products.
4. Executive Summary: Rewritten proposal by BTM's CIO.
